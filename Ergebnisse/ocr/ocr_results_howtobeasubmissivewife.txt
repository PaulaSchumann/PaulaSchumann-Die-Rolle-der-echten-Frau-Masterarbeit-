A Submissive wife should remember that she

Nagging will not encourage him to want to

flirt with him, make him want to spend time
with you because he enjoys your company
not because you nag him constantly:
Happier husbands are always more willing to
help out in the home:
However; if he refuses to help accept his
choice and do not start arguing; you are the
keeper of the home; and he is the provider of
the home:
