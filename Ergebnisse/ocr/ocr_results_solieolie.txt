The beginning of Feminism is the most

everything that followed after it depended upon
the basic assumptions they made. Prove those
assumptions wrong, refute them, and you pull

In fact; when left to our own "free will" _

in the most
egalitarian societies, women
continue to mostly choose careers
involving
people (nurses, caregivers, teachers, etc:)
while men often choose to do manual work or
work with machines (engineers, construction,
etc). Since these differences in career choice
become even more
in the most
feminist countries; we can conclude that it is
not due to societal factors, but by the design

"This at last is bone of my bones

10 WAYS TO SHOW REVERENCE
TO OUR HUSBANDS
1.Do not be
argumentative.
2.Do not talk bad about him to others.
3.Do not roll your eyes, sigh under your breath, etc behind
his back or in front of him.
4.Do not say no to sex:
5.Do not always insist on your way.
6.Serve him first.
7.Make
pleasant for him (keeping tidy his bedside
table, desk, favorite seating area, etc; teaching the
children to respect him, making meals he loves, having a
attitude_
you get the idea):
8.Do not contradict him behind his back.
9.Tell him you
appreciate him, encourage him, and be
excited for the things he is excited about (even if you
aren't or have trouble sharing his sentiments).
10.Listen to him, in your obedience, yes, but also by being
attentive when he
speaks to you.

The wearing of fabric head coverings in worship
was
universally the practice of Christian women
until the twentieth century. What happened? Did
we
suddenly find some biblical truth to which
the saints for thousands of years were blind? Or
were our biblical views of women gradually
eroded by the modern feminist movement that
has infiltrated the Church of Jesus Christ which
is
'the pillar and ground of the truth:'

Do you think you and I have sufficiently
considered that we are always looked upon by
angels, and that
desire to learn by us the
wisdom of God? The reason why our sisters
appear in the House of God with their heads
covered is
because of the angels'. The apostle
says that a woman is to have a
covering upon her
head;, because of the angels, since the angels are
present in the assembly and they mark every act
of indecorum, and therefore everything is to be
conducted with decency and order in the
presence of the angelic spirits.

Feminists hate the doctrine of headccovers
because it speaks to God's created order:
Destroy our
understanding of God's creation
order and the purpose thereof; and you
undermine home and family as well as the
church and society. If we'd not done away with
headcovers as we did, we'd have a much easier
time defending marriage as between man and
woman: By undermining headcovers, we
opened the pathway to the sexual morass we
find ourselves facing and, as a result;
undermined our ability to stand against
women being considered or installed as
leaders in the church in offices such as
deacons, pastors, and elders. This is so because
when you
or undermine Scripture in one
area, it becomes so much easier to do So in

If your marriage is rooted in Christ; you already

foundation, and you can have and maintain a strong
marriage and incredible connection with children: The

hinder that; but like I said, with Christ

navigate that:
Perhaps you think you're too young and

get your health in order: Before marriage; focus on
fixing your health problems as much as you can and
focus on a
lifestyle that supports fertility (eating
nourishing and nutrient dense food, avoiding toxins,
being active and getting outside, etc).
women are scared of motherhood and
childbirth; oftentimes because of trauma in their
upbringing, so
think pushing
children will
make these

Remember that you will never be ready- there is
no
'perfect" time to have children: Most of the married
couples that I know that waited to have children;
especially for several years, always say that all
thought
needed to do before children pales in
comparison to the joy their children bring: Usually,
say
wish
wouldn't have waited.
Also, don't marry a man that doesn't want
children or wants to wait an indefinite amount of time
before having children. While some men might
change; you can't bank on it: Oftentimes; the wife
starts to want children and is faced with a
not yet'
or
not ever.
This can be extremely difficult for a
woman to face.

to

Again; being a homemaker is not about having "enough money"
As a homemaker; you prioritize your work at home way above any work
you may do outside of the home.
As a traditional homemaker; you know the work you do at home is the
most valuable:
Why?
Because no one else replace you as you serve your husband your children;
and manage your home with excellence
God has literally picked *you
to care for and serve your
family, and to
with a joyous heart as unto Him:
Whether you are a wife with children or without children yet; NO ONE can

Many women see the command to
their
husbands as
oppressive. How can something God
created be oppressive?
There is an order to life. The husband is the head of
the wife as Christ is the head of the husband. We
should not corrupt something God has already
made beautifull

If men and women see the Biblical dynamic

The Bible compares the dynamic between
husband and his wife to the dynamic between
Christ and his church:
Is the church called to submit and
Christ?
Should we be resentful of our call to be obedient to
Christ?

obeying Christ is the best thing for Us. Submitting

There is a reason why Satan tempted Eve first.
Instead of obeying, Eve pulled Adam into sin; and
Adam, instead of doing what God had called him to
do, followed Eve into sin.
It ultimately reveals
a rebellious attitude. Imagine
if the Church said
no, actually,
I don't want to
submit and obey Christ, that sounds abusive'
NO! It' s beautiful, there' s
a reason
why God
designed it that way.

Looking at your husband as another child or
resenting him for not doing housework is
incredibly disrespectful. It says to him that you
don't
appreciate all he does It can be prideful of us
to think "Iwork so hard around here and he
doesn'tl:
Does he tell you that you should work 40
hours a week to be the breadwinner? (If so, then
you certainly don't have the energy to do all you
should at home. And wouldn't THAT be the main
problem?) The solution should not be wishing your
husband were a
pseudo-housewifel And listen; it'$
not about how much or little your husband should
help you around the house and with the children;
but rather your attitude about his help.

When our children are young especially,
motherhood seems all
consuming: But the more
efficient we are, the more restful it can be. We
utilize nap times; evenings, early mornings; and
playtime when the babies are preoccupied. Having
the right priorities and not overwhelming our
schedules is beneficial to us as well. As the
children get older you have help from them too so
it gets easier. And one

all move out,
it will be much easier for you, but your husband
will still have to provide, even after he retires.

1. Let's start with the basics -
definitions:
Modesty: dressing or behaving so as
to avoid impropriety or indecency,
especially to avoid attracting s3xual
attention (typically used of a woman);
free from ostentation or showy
extravagance
Indecent: not conforming with
generally accepted standards of
behavior or propriety; obscene.
Ostentation: pretentious and vulgar
display, especially of wealth and
luxury, intended to impress or attract
notice
Inappropriate: not suitable or proper

2. Biblical principles
We can take principles found in
scripture and apply them to our lives:
If women were not to adorn
themselves with braided hair or pearls
(1 Timothy 2.9) because it was showy,
distracting; and vain, what does this
tell us about how we should dress?

3. Culture:
This is not always the best gauge
depending on how s3xualized the
culture has become, but in many
societies, there are standards for
what is appropriate or not.
Sometimes, failure to adhere to
cultural standards is obvious and
viewed as highly inappropriate.

which means that clothes will look
different on each person:
Someone with long; skinny legs might
find that her shorts are too short Or
draw too much attention to her legs,
whereas
wouldn't on a
shorty:
A
woman with a big chest might not
be modest in the same V-neck as
someone with a smaller chest.
A curvy girl might be over-
accentuating her figure in a body-con
dress, that wouldn't on a slimmer girl.
Be cognizant of your body type and
how your clothes fit on you:

This is especially important when it comes to

your children doesn't mean you neglect your

It means giving your husband the respect that

It's allowing your children to see how much you
love each other through physical affection, kind
words, and service

When we use words like
more than
and "just"=
we immediately cheapen the vocations of
mother, wife, home keeper. It reveals a low of
these roles:
How is it possible to be "just" the helpmeet in
the beautiful and sacred covenant of marriage
that is the imagery of Christ's love for the
church?
How can we be "just" nurturers, teachers,
guides and raisers of the next generation of
human souls?
How can we "just" manage an entire household,
keeping everyone clean, fed, healthy, literally
making the house functional and peaceful for
several different people and personalities?
How can we look at these weighty and
important tasks and think; There's so much
more beyond this"?

Maybe you have a desire to have a business or
side-hustle, but feel like you
a.) don't have time or
b.) feel like it takes all of your time:
You don't *necessarily* have to throw in the
towel and give up that desire. You can still have
side hustle or business without it overtaking
your life and while still being able to prioritize
your home and family:
Here' s are 5 steps to do that:

--- Erkannt in 2023-05-11_20-09-20_UTC_3.jpg ---

@Solieoso
1. Be a master of your time:
The bottom line is that if you find yourself
unable to get the work done that you need, or
thatyour work is taking over your life, you have
a time management problem: You have to be in
charge of the time you have: You will probably
have to make some minor or major changes to
your life, and that's okay:
You have to be intentional: You can'tjust dilly-
dally through your tasks and do everything on a
whim: This is a huge time waster.
You and your family will be the better for it:

2. The easier your home is to manage, the easier
it will be/the more time you will have to manage
a business.
This means
having systems and routines in

It means no clutter and junk and constant mess:
It means organized spaces:
Having meals planned and everything you need

4. Move online.
Physical products take the most time and
money, the least flexibility, and are the hardest
to scale. See if you can transition your business
online or into e-products.
Examples:
Ifyou are a baker, create e-recipe books or
courses for stay-at-home moms to make their
own delectable and beautiful baked goods.
Ifyou are an artist; sell prints online. Only sell
the physical copies for a premium:
If you are a music teacher, teach group classes
through Zoom and package that with a course
If you are a hair stylist; teach other women how
to cut their own hair, their children's hair, their
husbands hair, etc through online Zooms, or
courses (or both).

2. The wife is the manager of the home She
oversees all domestic
activity, makes sure there
are
systems in place to get them accomplished,
and delegates tasks as needed:
3. The husband approves of a wife's decision to
make income or not: Wives must heed their
husbands' wishes. If he asks her to bring in
income, she should do so joyfully, and find a
sustainable avenue that allows her to help. If her
husband does not wish for her to make income;
she should honor that and be content without

Being a tradwife is about so much more than

To be a traditional wife, you don't need:

a homestead
a
big house
lots of poofy dresses
You DO need:
a

a heart of service

There are women that would give anything to be

However, many modern women LIVE for their

Children- young children especially- have a
physiological NEED for their mothers.
For extended maternity leave to truly make
sense, it would need to extend long enough to a
point where the child could take care of
themselves for some time or when the child
starts school:

love, serving others and giving ourselves away:
Why shouldnt it be the same for our
relationships? Why are so many people so
resistant to the idea of doing something for the
person you love more than anything?
Im not talking about doing things for him out of
fear that he will leave, or out of any other fear
but from a place of LOVE:

Most women are to marry, but if

an individual.
did God put you specifically on
this earth?

human) .
2_
As a wife and mother, she was a
homemaker. She prioritized her
