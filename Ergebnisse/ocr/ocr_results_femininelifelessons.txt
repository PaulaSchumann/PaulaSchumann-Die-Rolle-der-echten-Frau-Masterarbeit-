Just because you did something wrong
in the past doesn't mean you can't
advocate against it now: It doesn't make
you ahypocrite, you grew: Don't let
people use
past to invalidate your
current mindset
Growth:

You're an answer
In case you didn't know; you're an answer
not a problem: God put you on this earth
to change the lives of others. You are
valued, and have a purpose. God's plan
for your life is greater than any plan
could ever dream of for yourself:
He
you one earth for a specific purpose: You
don't realize just how much you impact
the lives of others everyday: Now go and
change the world because you were
created by God to do great things!

Ithink it's important we realize that,
whether man or woman, young or old,
forgiveness is KEY to living a better and
fulfilling life.
One cannot
fully enjoy the goodness of
God's Love, ifthere is still a piece of us being
unforgiving or
towards a certain
people.
When you forgive, you make room for love
